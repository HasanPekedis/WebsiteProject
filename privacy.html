            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: January 26, 2020</p>
            <p>Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy
                to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive
                through our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or
                applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define
                a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <h3>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time
                such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any
                material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the
                Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date”
                above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</p>
            <h3>Collection and Use of this Information</h3>
            <h4>INFORMATION COLLECTED OR RECEIVED FROM YOU</h4>
            <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your
                use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy
                and easily navigate our Services.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Account Information.</strong>&nbsp;If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information
                that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address and phone number
                (“PII”). If you create an Account through the Site, we may also collect other information that is not
                considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies.</strong>&nbsp;Like many website
                owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect
                certain information.</p>
            <p><strong>“Cookies”</strong>&nbsp;are small text files that are placed on your device by a Web server when
                you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve
                logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use
                Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve
                our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services
                and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser
                options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note,
                however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the
                Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may
                also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of
                Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>“Web Beacons”</strong>&nbsp;(also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics
                with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver
                or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many
                visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which
                are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an
                e-mail).</p>
            <p><strong>Information Related to Use of the Services.</strong>&nbsp;Our servers automatically record
                certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”),
                including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include
                information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web
                page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to
                which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our
                Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we
                analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our
                Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and
                preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about
                how our Services are used.</p>
            <p><strong>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device.</strong>&nbsp;We collect certain information that your
                mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating
                system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.&nbsp;</p>
            <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
            <h3>Information that We Share with Third Parties</h3>
            <p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</p>
            <p><strong>Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</strong>&nbsp;We may engage third-party services
                providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers
                have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly
                obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Information Shared with Third Parties.</strong>&nbsp;We may share aggregated information and
                non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling
                and other similar purposes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</strong>&nbsp;Information that we
                collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by
                a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets
                are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our
                assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with
                the transaction.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</strong>&nbsp;We cooperate
                with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We
                may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as
                we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process
                (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and
                safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider
                illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
            <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
            <h3>The Security of Your Information</h3>
            <p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information
                that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When
                you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL or other technologies.
                Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing
                information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any
                information.</p>
            <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
            <p>Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties
                (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that
                is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party
                Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the
                content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your
                information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that
                you access.</p>
            <h3>International Transfer</h3>
            <p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province,
                country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in
                your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we
                may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.</p>
            <h3>Our Policy Toward Children</h3>
            <p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children
                under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such
                information from our files as soon as possible.</p>
            <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
            <p>California residents may request and obtain from us, once a year, free of charge, a list of third
                parties, if any, to which we disclosed their PII for direct marketing purposes during the preceding
                calendar year and the categories of PII shared with those third parties. If you are a California
                resident and wish to obtain that information, please submit your request by sending us an email at
                help@workrunner.io with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line.</p> <br>
            <h3>Questions?</h3>
            <p>Please contact us at&nbsp;help@workrunner.io&nbsp;if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.</p>
