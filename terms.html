            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: January 11, 2020</p>
            <p>Welcome to the Workrunner Inc. (“Workrunner”) website located at www.workrunner.io (the “Site”). Please
                read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) and our Privacy Policy (www.workrunner.io/privacy) carefully
                because they govern your use of our Site and our software products and services accessible via our Site,
                our (business) application development platform “Platform” that enables you to build your own business
                applications, our market place “Market” that you may access third-party applications and applications
                (“Apps”) build by us that you may or may not access through our market running on our Platform. To make
                these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services, Platform, Market and Apps are collectively called
                the “Services”.</p>
            <h4>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h4>
            <p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these
                Terms, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such
                as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind
                that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that
                company or other legal entity.</p>
            <h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
            <p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy (www.workrunner.io/privacy) for information on how we collect, use and
                disclose information from our users. &nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is
                subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h4>CHANGES TO TERMS OR SERVICES</h4>
            <p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by
                posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review
                the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted
                modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms.
                If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because
                our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any
                time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>

                TERMS BY FOLLOWING THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURE SPECIFIED IN THE “ARBITRATION” SECTION BELOW, AND EXCEPT FOR
                CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE “ARBITRATION “SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN
                YOU AND WORKRUNNER WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO
                A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR
                REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

            <p>NEITHER WORKRUNNER NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES OR
                CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST
                PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST
                OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY
                TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
                PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT&nbsp;WORKRUNNER&nbsp;HAS BEEN INFORMED
                OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF
                ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
                CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
            <p>IN NO EVENT WILL&nbsp;WORKRUNNER&nbsp;S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS
                OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT EXCEED THE LOWER OF: (I) THE AMOUNTS YOU
                HAVE PAID TO&nbsp;WORKRUNNER&nbsp;FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT; OR (II) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS
                ($10000), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO WORKRUNNER, AS APPLICABLE.</p>
            <p>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE
                BARGAIN BETWEEN&nbsp;WORKRUNNER&nbsp;AND YOU.</p>
            <h4>GENERAL TERMS</h4>
            <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between&nbsp;Workrunner and
                you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or
                written understandings or agreements between&nbsp;Workrunner&nbsp;and you regarding the Services and
                Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator
                appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent
                jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice
                in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
                permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not
                assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without&nbsp;Workrunner’s prior
                written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be
                null.&nbsp;Workrunner&nbsp;may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the
                foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted
                assigns.</p>
            <p>Any notices or other communications provided by&nbsp;Workrunner&nbsp;under these Terms, including those
                regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the
                Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice
                is transmitted.</p>
            <p>Workrunner’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
                such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing
                and signed by a duly authorized representative of Workrunner. Except as expressly set forth in these
                Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice
                to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
            <h4>CONTACT INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms or the Services, please contact Workrunner at
